Log4Net WCF Appender
=================

1. *Overview*
	A log4net appender that pushes log entries to a WCF service. 

2. Sample Config:
<pre><code>&lt;log4net&gt;
	&lt;appender name="WCFAppender" type="WCFAppender_log4net.WCFAppender, WCFAppender-log4net"&gt;
			&lt;BindingType&gt;HTTP&lt;/BindingType&gt;
			&lt;RenderOnClient&gt;True&lt;/RenderOnClient&gt;
			&lt;URL&gt;http://localhost:43573/WCFLogger.svc&lt;/URL&gt;
			&lt;layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout" value="%date [%thread] %-5level %logger - %message%newline" /&gt;
	&lt;/appender&gt;
	&lt;root&gt;
		&lt;level value="ALL" /&gt;
		&lt;appender-ref ref=""WCFAppender"" /&gt;
	&lt;/root&gt;
&lt;/log4net&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre>
The WCF appender has two modes: render on client and render on service.  The render on client takes the log event data 
and renders the log string on the client and sends it to the WCF service as a string.  This is the most interoperable as there is no object 
serialization taking place.  The render on server is a little more complex, but offers the benifit of controlling the rendering in a central place, 
and can be changed without redeploying your client.  The event is serialized to the server using .Net specific seralization, to avoid unknown type errors.  The type DLLs
much match on the client and on the server for server side rendering to work.

The implementations of both functions log to log4net on the server side for ease of configurability; however, this implementation is left open for you 
to change however you'd like.
